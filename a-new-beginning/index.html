            <p>I remember very well my first time using a computer, and I have my sister to thank that, when the new mysterious machine came home, she taught me how to browse the Internet, how to install end uninstall the softwares that i needed and obviously - i was just a boy - how to play video games.</p>

<p>That boy is now growth, many years have passed, more than ten, no doubt about it, and probably even more than fifteen, and now that boy is at the opposite side of the world trying to feel what it means being in the role of who makes possible all the marvellous things that we see on the screen of our devices, that we use all the time and that are by now an essential part - can we say inescapable? - of our lives.</p>

<p>I'm in San Francisco, the center of the tech world, to attend one of the most prestigious and demanding bootcamp in the world: <strong>Hack Reactor</strong>. Twelve hours a day of coding - and in all truth the most of the time are more then 'just' twelve - a new topic every two days, daily lectures on a wide range of arguments: data structures, frameworks, algorithms, style and syntax best practices. All that happens in an amazing environment, surrounded by smart people, all motivated to push their limits every single day. <br>
The school is electrifying and engaging, so finding the motivation is not hard, actually is the opposite, everything and everybody seems to say: you can do it, you can win every challenge, don't give up, trust yourself, push yourself everyday and show the best of you, because this part of you is the part that we love! <br>
I never tried something like this before and is very difficult to describe, especially if the reader is not American and is accustomed to the unproductive, depressing and humiliating Italian university framework. To understand my experience you must take all the things that you had experimented in your lives, throw them in the trash, and come here to see with your own eyes. Is all of this expensive? Yes, it is, I can't deny it. Is it worth it? Definitely yes!</p>

<p>The idea beyond HR is very simple: take some aspiring software developers and, in three months, transmogrify them in Senior Developers, ready to enter the labor market with an enviable curriculum</p>

<p>I'm ready, I'm working hard and I'll keep working hard, I'm ready to commit all my energies and time to this bootcamp: <strong>it's my dream and I want to make it real</strong>.</p>

<p>Thus begins my experience at Hack Reactor!</p>
